# DigiPi RigHat
## (Yet an other interface hat for famous DigiPi)

Please be patient, I am still editing and adding instructions.

This is an interface hat for a DigiPi by KM6LYW (www.digipi.org).
I am releasing fabrication files under open source license so anyone can order PCB's with SMD mounted components.

## Schematic
Schematic is based on KM6LYW's original documentation at www.digpi.org
PCB was designed to utilize the SMD resistors and MOSFET to fit under tight Pi Zero configuration anbd be flush with display hat.
