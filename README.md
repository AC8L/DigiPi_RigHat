# DigiPi RigHat
## (Yet an other interface hat for famous DigiPi)

Please be patient, I am still editing and adding instructions.

This is an interface hat for a DigiPi by KM6LYW (www.digipi.org).
I am releasing fabrication files under open source license so anyone can order PCB's with SMD mounted components.

## Schematic
Schematic is based on KM6LYW's original documentation at www.digpi.org. PCB was designed to utilize the SMD resistors and MOSFET to fit under the tight Pi Zero configuration and be flush with the display hat.

## Through-hole components
These are the additional THT components to be sourced for the final assembly:

- 2.54mm Double Row Female Long Pin 11mm Breakaway PCB Board Pin Header Connector

- TRRS Connector

- LED's

- JST 3-pin Male-Female pair

## PCB Ordering and final assembly
1. Use fabrication files in DigiHat_Fabrication_Files folder to order the PCB. PCB will arrive with resistors and thre MOSFET soldered.
2. Solther PIN header and TRRS connector to the bottom of the PCB.
3. Sother LED's at the top, pay attention to the polarity. The negative pin (short pin, the cathode) goes to the square pad.
